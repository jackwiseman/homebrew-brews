# homebrew-brews

A collection of software I use daily but have yet to submit to homebrew-core

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install jackwiseman/brews/<formula>`

Or `brew tap jackwiseman/brews` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
